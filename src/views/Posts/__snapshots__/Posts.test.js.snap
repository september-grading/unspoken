          Thank you so much for everything you've taught me. Your genuine interest in our learning and passion for coding shine through every day, and kept me excited even when I was exhausted. I'll miss you so much!

          Over 5 years?? Wild that people so far away can meet and learn about and know each other. One day I'll drive down to you again and we can HUG once more!!!

          I was worried about going into tech; the biases from others, the difficult questions they'd ask me, the internal conflicts. But being taught by Julie was the best introduction into this world I could have asked for. I saw how intelligent, powerful and graceful she is, and it inspired me to be as such. Im sure Julie has some stories too to have gotten to where she is now, and I hope she knows that she has become a part of mine.

          I am so glad we all get to have this experience together! Julie, thank you so much for being here to provide guidance for the very beginning of our coding journey! We couldn't have done it without you. And thank you September for being such a fun, wonderful, and bright group of people. I am so glad we get to learn together and help each other grow. &lt;3

          We're so lucky to have an instructor like Julie and a cohort like this. We've learned so much, including how to be supports for one another. Julie, KIT, and don't ever change. Come visit us!
